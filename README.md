Chi2 contengency independence test

Q4. TeleCall uses 4 centers around the globe to process customer order forms. They audit a certain % of the customer order forms.
Any error in order form renders it defective and has to be reworked before processing. 
The manager wants to check whether the defective % varies by centre.
Please analyze the data at 5% significance level and help the manager draw appropriate inferences.

Assume Null Hypothesis as Ho: Independence of categorical variables (customer order forms defective % does not varies by centre) Thus, Alternative hypothesis as Ha Dependence of categorical variables (customer order forms defective % varies by centre)

Inference: As (p_value = 0.2771) > (Î± = 0.05); Accept Null Hypthesis i.e. Independence of categorical variables Thus, customer order forms defective % does not varies by centre.
